✅ **Notes**:  
- Save your screenshots in a folder called `screenshots` in your frontend root.  
- Replace placeholder URLs with actual paths.  
- Add or remove features as needed for your project.

If you want, I can also **write a ready-to-use README with actual screenshots of your current frontend** if you provide the images. Do you want me to do that?
